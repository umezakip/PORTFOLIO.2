<b class="title6">About Me</b>
<div class="body1">
<p class="creating-engaging-and">I’m an American born designer with Japanese and South American heritage. Fruitful of this, I am natively trilingual in Spanish, Portuguese, English. I enjoy traveling to other countries, all sports, and photography.</p>
<p class="creating-engaging-and">At SUNY University at Albany, I received a bachelors degree in Economics as a first generation university graduate.</p>
<p class="creating-engaging-and">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="creating-engaging-and">I have a passion for growth and the determination to succeed. As a multimedia designer with over 3 years of experience in the design industry I have and continue to learn more about design every day. Over the past couple of years working as a Graphic Designer I have honed skills in software including Figma, Adobe: Photoshop; Illustrator; InDesign; Premier Pro; After Effects, Canva, and more. The journey of mastering design does not end there. Since then I have also acquired Front-End Development skills (HTML, CSS) in order to create a portfolio website and showcase my skills in a personalized method. This is a testament to my goal of continuous growth and proficiency.</p>
<p class="creating-engaging-and">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="creating-engaging-and">If you are looking for a versatile designer that gives their all to their craft I am the perfect candidate for you. If having to describe myself using one word, I would choose unstoppable. I chose to change my career path because it was my calling. When designing, no matter the project or industry, it never feels like work. This not only allows me to maintain a positive aura when working but also allows for unmatched efficiency and output. I am determined to be the best version of myself possible and bringing that mentality to any team or project.</p>
